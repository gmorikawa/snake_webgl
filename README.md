## Overview

This is a project that I had made in university in 2017. The main objective was to understand how make a simple game engine from scratch by using HTML and javascript.

Basically, all the game is rendered in a canvas element and draw by using WebGL.

The first commit of this repository is the original project written in 2017. The following commits are just some refactoring done in the original code.
